      <p class="hero-description">
        Pluto, once considered the ninth planet of our solar system, is now recognized as a dwarf planet residing in the Kuiper Belt—a vast region of icy bodies and remnants from the formation of the solar system. Despite its small size, Pluto has captivated scientists and the public alike due to its complex geology, dynamic atmosphere, and unexpected level of geological activity. Discovered in 1930, Pluto remained an enigma until NASA's New Horizons mission provided humanity’s first close-up view in 2015.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Pluto is a complex and fascinating dwarf planet located at the edge of our solar system in the Kuiper Belt. It was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 and was considered the ninth planet until 2006, when the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified it as a dwarf planet due to its inability to clear its orbit of other debris. Despite its downgrade, Pluto remains an essential object of study for astronomers due to its unique characteristics. Pluto is primarily composed of rock and ice and has a diameter of about 2,377 kilometers (1,477 miles). It exhibits complex and varied terrain, including mountains made of water ice, vast plains of nitrogen ice, and possible cryovolcanoes. Its tenuous atmosphere consists mainly of nitrogen, with minor amounts of methane and carbon monoxide, which can expand and contract as Pluto moves closer or farther from the Sun. The discovery of active geology and potential subsurface oceans has made Pluto an exciting target for continued exploration.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Namesake</h2>
      <p>
        Pluto was named by an 11-year-old schoolgirl named Venetia Burney from Oxford, England, who had a strong interest in classical mythology. She suggested the name Pluto after the Roman god of the underworld, which was fitting for such a distant and cold celestial body. The suggestion was passed on to the Lowell Observatory, where the newly discovered object was being studied, and it was officially adopted on March 24, 1930. Interestingly, the name also honors Percival Lowell, whose initials PL are the first letters of Pluto. In mythology, Pluto (Greek equivalent Hades) ruled over the dead and was known for being distant and mysterious, just like the dwarf planet bearing his name. The tradition of naming planets and their satellites after mythological figures continued with Pluto’s moons, which are named Charon, Nix, Hydra, Styx, and Kerberos—all figures associated with the underworld in Greek mythology.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
      <p>
        Pluto is much smaller than Earth, with a diameter of about 2,377 kilometers (1,477 miles), making it roughly two-thirds the diameter of our Moon. Despite its size, Pluto has five known moons, with Charon being the largest. Pluto orbits the Sun at a distance that ranges from 4.4 to 7.3 billion kilometers (2.7 to 4.5 billion miles) due to its highly elliptical orbit. On average, it lies about 5.9 billion kilometers (3.7 billion miles) from the Sun, or 39.5 astronomical units (AU). It takes sunlight more than five hours to reach Pluto. This distant orbit also means that Pluto takes about 248 Earth years to complete a single revolution around the Sun. The orbital path is tilted by about 17 degrees from the plane of the solar system, which means it travels well above and below the ecliptic. Interestingly, for about 20 years of each orbit, Pluto is actually closer to the Sun than Neptune. This last occurred from 1979 to 1999.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
      <p>
        Pluto's orbit is both eccentric and inclined, making it unique among the planets and dwarf planets of our solar system. While its orbital period is 248 Earth years, its rotation period is approximately 6.4 Earth days. Unlike Earth, Pluto has a retrograde rotation, meaning it spins in the opposite direction to most planets. Moreover, Pluto's axis is tilted at an extreme angle of 122.5 degrees, causing it to essentially rotate on its side. This results in extreme seasonal variations and long periods of daylight or darkness. For instance, a single day-night cycle on Pluto lasts over six Earth days. Because of its elliptical orbit, the dwarf planet undergoes significant changes in surface temperature and atmospheric pressure, causing gases like nitrogen and methane to sublimate from the surface into the atmosphere and later condense back onto the surface as frost. This dynamic process contributes to seasonal weather patterns even in the frigid outer solar system.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Moons</h2>
      <p>
        Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. The largest and most significant of these is Charon, which is so massive relative to Pluto that the two objects are sometimes considered a double dwarf planet system. Charon is about half the diameter of Pluto and orbits just 19,640 kilometers (12,200 miles) away. The other four moons—Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra—are much smaller and irregular in shape. These moons were discovered between 2005 and 2012 using the Hubble Space Telescope. The Pluto-Charon system is tidally locked, meaning the same face of Pluto always points toward Charon and vice versa. This unique interaction provides scientists with valuable information about the gravitational dynamics in binary systems. The New Horizons mission revealed surface features on Charon, such as canyons and plains, hinting at a geologically active past. The origins of Pluto’s moons are likely tied to a giant impact event early in its history, similar to how Earth’s Moon was formed.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Pluto is believed to be differentiated, meaning it has distinct layers: a rocky core, a mantle of water ice, and a crust of exotic ices such as methane and nitrogen. Beneath its icy surface, there may exist a subsurface ocean of liquid water, kept warm by the heat from radioactive decay in its core. Evidence for this ocean includes the presence of surface features like cryovolcanoes and tectonic ridges. The New Horizons mission also discovered that Pluto's surface is geologically young in many areas, suggesting recent or ongoing internal activity. Unlike Earth, Pluto does not have a magnetic field, but its surface shows signs of resurfacing processes. The geological diversity of Pluto was unexpected and has challenged previous assumptions about the capabilities of small, cold celestial bodies. Large mountains made of water ice, vast plains of frozen nitrogen, and possible glacial movement all point to a planet that is far more complex than initially thought.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Surface and Atmosphere</h2>
      <p>
        Pluto’s surface is one of the most varied in the solar system. It includes towering ice mountains, smooth plains, and dark, cratered regions. The most iconic feature is the heart-shaped Tombaugh Regio, composed of two distinct lobes—one of which, Sputnik Planitia, is a nitrogen-ice plain believed to be an ancient impact basin. Other features include possible cryovolcanoes like Wright Mons and Piccard Mons, which suggest the presence of internal heat. Pluto’s atmosphere is tenuous and primarily composed of nitrogen, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide. It undergoes significant seasonal changes, expanding when Pluto is closer to the Sun and freezing onto the surface as frost when it's farther away. This creates dynamic weather patterns, including haze layers that extend hundreds of kilometers above the surface. Observations from New Horizons also revealed a blue tint in the atmosphere due to complex hydrocarbon particles called tholins, which form when ultraviolet sunlight interacts with methane.
