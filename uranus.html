      <p class="hero-description">
        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and the third-largest in diameter in our solar system. It's known for its unique tilt — it spins on its side — and its pale blue color caused by methane in the atmosphere. Despite being less explored, Uranus remains a world of mystery, with a complex system of rings and moons.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Uranus is classified as an ice giant due to its cold temperatures and icy composition. It is composed primarily of water, ammonia, and methane ices, along with hydrogen and helium. One of its most distinctive features is its extreme axial tilt of 98 degrees, meaning it rotates nearly perpendicular to the plane of the solar system. This results in extreme seasonal variations unlike any other planet.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Namesake</h2>
      <p>
        Uranus is named after the ancient Greek deity of the sky, Ouranos. It is the only planet whose name is derived from Greek mythology rather than Roman. The planet was discovered by astronomer William Herschel in 1781, making it the first planet discovered with a telescope.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
      <p>
        Uranus has a diameter of about 50,724 kilometers (31,518 miles), making it the third-largest planet in diameter. It is located about 2.9 billion kilometers (1.8 billion miles) from the Sun, or 19.8 AU. One year on Uranus — the time it takes to complete one orbit around the Sun — is equivalent to about 84 Earth years.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
      <p>
        Uranus rotates once every 17.24 Earth hours, but its extreme tilt makes its rotation appear to roll along its orbit. This leads to bizarre day-night cycles during its 84-year-long orbit. Each pole gets 42 years of sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness. Its orbit is slightly elliptical and moderately tilted in relation to the Sun.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Moons</h2>
      <p>
        Uranus has 27 known moons, most of which are named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. Notable moons include Titania, Oberon, Miranda, Ariel, and Umbriel. These moons vary greatly in size and composition, with Miranda being particularly fascinating due to its patchwork surface and evidence of geological activity.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>
        The internal structure of Uranus is thought to consist of a rocky core surrounded by icy materials, with a gaseous atmosphere rich in hydrogen, helium, and methane. The planet’s low heat emission suggests a different internal heat distribution compared to Jupiter and Saturn. Unlike Saturn and Jupiter, Uranus has very little internal heat left from its formation.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Surface and Atmosphere</h2>
      <p>
        Uranus lacks a true solid surface. Its atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The methane absorbs red light and reflects blue and green light, giving the planet its characteristic cyan color. Winds in the atmosphere can reach speeds of up to 900 km/h (560 mph), and large storms have been observed by telescopes on Earth and from space.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        Uranus has only been visited once, by NASA’s Voyager 2 in 1986. The spacecraft provided close-up images and valuable data on the planet’s atmosphere, rings, and moons. Since then, astronomers have studied Uranus through telescopes and space observatories. Several space agencies are considering future missions to study this cold, distant world more closely.
