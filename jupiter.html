      <p class="hero-description">
        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in our solar system. Known for its immense size, swirling atmosphere, and iconic Great Red Spot, Jupiter plays a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of the solar system. As a gas giant, it lacks a solid surface but contains dozens of moons and a powerful magnetic field that extends millions of kilometers into space.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter is a gas giant, composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, similar to a star. It has no solid surface and is best known for its banded appearance and the Great Red Spot — a giant storm larger than Earth that has raged for centuries. Jupiter’s massive gravitational pull helps protect inner planets by capturing or redirecting asteroids and comets. This giant planet has an immense system of rings, though fainter than Saturn’s, and it radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Namesake</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter is named after the king of the Roman gods. In Greek mythology, he corresponds to Zeus. Due to its brightness and grandeur in the night sky, ancient civilizations associated Jupiter with supreme deities. The name reflects the planet’s dominant presence in the solar system and its immense size and influence.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of about 142,984 kilometers (88,846 miles). It is over 11 times wider than Earth and has a volume large enough to hold more than 1,300 Earths. Jupiter orbits the Sun at an average distance of 778 million kilometers (484 million miles), or 5.2 AU. This distance results in a long orbital period of nearly 12 Earth years.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
      <p>
        Despite its size, Jupiter has the shortest day in the solar system. It completes a rotation on its axis in just about 10 hours, leading to extreme equatorial bulging. Its orbit around the Sun takes approximately 11.86 Earth years. Jupiter’s axial tilt is small, about 3 degrees, so it experiences minimal seasonal changes compared to Earth or Mars.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Moons</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter has at least 95 known moons, including the four large Galilean moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto — discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system, even larger than Mercury. These moons are unique worlds, with Io being volcanically active, Europa suspected to harbor a subsurface ocean, and Callisto and Ganymede possessing intriguing geological and potential habitability features.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. Beneath its cloud layers lies a layer of metallic hydrogen, created under immense pressure, which contributes to its powerful magnetic field. Scientists believe Jupiter may have a rocky core, but the exact nature remains uncertain. Its outer atmosphere is made up of ammonia clouds, with complex weather systems and jet streams that encircle the planet.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Surface and Atmosphere</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter has no solid surface. What we see are its upper cloud layers, composed of ammonia crystals and other compounds. The atmosphere features alternating dark belts and bright zones due to intense jet streams. Storms, some larger than Earth, continuously churn in its upper layers. The most famous of these is the Great Red Spot, a persistent anticyclonic storm visible for over 350 years. Jupiter’s magnetosphere is the largest in the solar system, extending millions of kilometers and trapping intense radiation.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter has been visited by multiple spacecraft, including Pioneer, Voyager, Galileo, Cassini (during its flyby), New Horizons, and Juno — which is currently studying the planet’s atmosphere and magnetic field. ESA's JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is planned for a future mission to explore Jupiter’s moons, particularly Ganymede. These missions have provided valuable insights into the planet's structure, moons, and role in the solar system.
