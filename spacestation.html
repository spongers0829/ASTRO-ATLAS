        The International Space Station (ISS) is a marvel of human engineering and cooperation. As a habitable artificial satellite orbiting Earth, it functions as a unique microgravity and space environment research laboratory. It has hosted astronauts from 20 different countries and facilitated over 3,000 experiments, reshaping our understanding of science in space. Traveling at speeds exceeding 28,000 kilometers per hour, it completes one orbit around Earth every 90 minutes.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The International Space Station (ISS) is one of the most ambitious achievements of modern humanity. A symbol of unity and exploration, the ISS provides a long-term platform for scientific research, technology development, and international cooperation. It orbits Earth approximately every 90 minutes and is visible to the naked eye. From studying the effects of microgravity on the human body to monitoring Earth's climate, the ISS serves multiple purposes. Its modular structure allows ongoing expansion and adaptation, ensuring its continued relevance well into the future.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Origins & Development</h2>
      <p>
        The concept of a permanent space station was first proposed in the mid-20th century, but it wasn't until 1998 that the ISS began taking shape. The project was born out of collaboration between major space agencies including NASA, Roscosmos, JAXA, ESA, and CSA. The launch of the Zarya module marked the first step in this massive endeavor. Over the years, more than 30 missions contributed to its assembly. The ISS has withstood solar storms, micrometeorites, and shifting international priorities, standing as a testament to human resilience and teamwork. Today, the station comprises dozens of modules and trusses, forming a complex and dynamic orbital outpost.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Structure & Modules</h2>
      <p>
        The ISS includes pressurized laboratories, crew quarters, airlocks, and multiple docking ports for visiting spacecraft. The truss structure supports large solar arrays that provide power. Key components include the U.S. Destiny Laboratory, which hosts hundreds of experiments, and the European Columbus Laboratory, designed for multidisciplinary science. The Japanese Kibo module adds extra capacity with a pressurized module, exposed platform, and logistics carrier. Russia's Zvezda module functions as the primary service area, complete with sleeping quarters and navigation systems. These interconnected modules allow a small community of astronauts to live and work in a fully functional orbital habitat.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Science on Board</h2>
      <p>
        Research aboard the ISS has revolutionized our understanding of science in space. Experiments in human physiology help researchers understand how the body changes without gravity, providing insights for both astronauts and Earth-based medicine. Physical sciences have also flourished, with studies on fluid behavior, combustion, and material science. The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer installed on the ISS searches for dark matter and antimatter, pushing the boundaries of astrophysics. Agricultural experiments test how plants grow in space, aiding future missions to the Moon and Mars. Every mission expands the station's contributions to global knowledge.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Crew and Life</h2>
      <p>
        Life aboard the ISS is highly structured. Astronauts follow a strict schedule that includes science tasks, maintenance work, exercise, meals, and personal time. Crew members exercise for about two hours a day to combat the effects of weightlessness. Living in microgravity means adapting to new ways of eating, sleeping, and using the restroom. The station is equipped with cameras, communication systems, and environmental controls to ensure safety. Crew members often participate in educational events, talking to students around the world to inspire the next generation of space explorers.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>International Collaboration</h2>
      <p>
        The ISS brings together countries with diverse political, economic, and technological backgrounds. It involves over 15 nations working in harmony toward shared scientific goals. Beyond the technical cooperation, this partnership has fostered a spirit of peaceful collaboration. Each partner contributes hardware, launch vehicles, or crew, and receives shared access to the station's facilities. This cooperation has served as a model for other international ventures, including proposed lunar bases and Mars missions. Despite geopolitical tensions on Earth, the ISS remains a beacon of unity in orbit.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Future of the ISS</h2>
      <p>
        As the ISS approaches the end of its planned life cycle, space agencies are evaluating its legacy and next steps. Some modules may transition into new platforms such as NASA’s Lunar Gateway or commercial space stations. Companies like Axiom Space plan to attach new modules to the ISS that could later operate independently. The station’s vast archive of scientific data and experience provides a roadmap for sustainable space habitats. Whether in Earth orbit, around the Moon, or in deep space, the knowledge gained from the ISS will guide the future of human spaceflight.
