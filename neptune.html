        Neptune, the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, is a dark, cold, and incredibly windy world. It is the smallest of the ice giants and is notable for its striking deep blue color and supersonic winds. Despite its distance, Neptune plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the solar system.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune is a dynamic ice giant, with an atmosphere composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The planet exhibits active and violent weather patterns, including the fastest winds recorded in the solar system. Its deep blue color comes from the absorption of red light by atmospheric methane, combined with unknown elements.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Namesake</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune is named after the Roman god of the sea. Its discovery in 1846 was a triumph of mathematical prediction rather than observation. It is the only planet located through mathematical calculations based on Uranus's orbit irregularities, leading to its identification by Johann Galle.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune has a diameter of about 49,244 kilometers (30,598 miles), slightly smaller than Uranus. It lies an average of 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles) from the Sun, or 30.1 AU. Due to its great distance, sunlight takes more than four hours to reach Neptune.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune completes one rotation every 16.11 hours, creating noticeable weather patterns and storm systems. A year on Neptune — the time it takes to orbit the Sun — lasts about 165 Earth years. Like Uranus, it has a slight axial tilt of about 28.3 degrees, resulting in seasonal cycles, though each season lasts over 40 Earth years.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Moons</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune has 14 known moons. The largest, Triton, orbits in a retrograde direction, suggesting it may be a captured Kuiper Belt object. Triton is geologically active, with geysers that erupt icy material. Other moons include Nereid, Proteus, and Larissa. These moons provide important clues about Neptune’s history and interactions.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune is made mostly of ices, water, ammonia, and methane, surrounding a small rocky core. Beneath its cloud tops lies a dense, hot fluid interior. The planet emits more heat than it receives from the Sun, suggesting an internal heat source. Like Uranus, Neptune lacks a solid surface.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Surface and Atmosphere</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune's atmosphere is one of the most active in the solar system, with winds reaching 2,100 kilometers per hour (1,300 mph). Giant storm systems, such as the Great Dark Spot observed by Voyager 2, come and go across the planet. The upper atmosphere contains methane, which gives Neptune its distinctive blue hue.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        NASA's Voyager 2 conducted the only flyby of Neptune in 1989, providing detailed images and crucial data on its atmosphere, rings, and moons. Since then, Neptune has been studied via telescopes and space observatories. Future missions are being proposed to explore the planet and Triton in more detail.
