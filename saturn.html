      <p class="hero-description">
        Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is renowned for its stunning ring system and is the second-largest planet in our solar system. Composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, Saturn is a gas giant that lacks a solid surface. Its beauty and mysteries continue to captivate scientists and space enthusiasts alike.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn is best known for its spectacular rings, which are made up of ice particles, rock fragments, and dust. Although other gas giants also have ring systems, Saturn’s are by far the most prominent and extensive. The planet has a low density — so low, in fact, that it would float in water if a large enough body of water existed. Saturn's atmosphere features banded cloud structures and massive storms, including a persistent hexagonal pattern at its north pole.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Namesake</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture and time. In Greek mythology, he is known as Cronus. The planet's slow orbit around the Sun and its majestic appearance contributed to this naming. It has been observed since ancient times and often associated with divinity, agriculture, and cosmic cycles.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn has a diameter of about 120,536 kilometers (74,900 miles), making it nine times wider than Earth. It is the second-largest planet in the solar system. Saturn orbits the Sun at an average distance of 1.4 billion kilometers (886 million miles), or 9.5 AU. One year on Saturn lasts about 29.5 Earth years due to its long orbital path.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn rotates extremely quickly — it completes one rotation approximately every 10.7 hours. This rapid spin flattens the planet at the poles and bulges it at the equator. Saturn’s axial tilt of 26.7 degrees leads to seasonal changes similar to those on Earth, though each season lasts over seven years.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Moons</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn has over 140 known moons, with Titan being the largest. Titan is larger than Mercury and has a thick atmosphere and methane lakes. Other fascinating moons include Enceladus, which ejects plumes of water vapor from its subsurface ocean, and Iapetus with its striking light and dark hemispheres. Saturn's moons are prime targets for astrobiology and future exploration.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. Beneath its upper cloud layers, pressure increases dramatically, likely forming a layer of metallic hydrogen and a small rocky core. Like Jupiter, Saturn’s interior generates more heat than it receives from the Sun, indicating active internal processes. The planet’s ring system extends thousands of kilometers but is incredibly thin — often only tens of meters thick.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Surface and Atmosphere</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn does not have a true surface. Its visible atmosphere is made of ammonia crystals, giving it a pale yellow hue. Beneath this layer lie more dynamic systems involving hydrogen and helium gas. High-speed winds race around the planet at up to 1,800 kilometers per hour (1,118 mph). Storms and atmospheric waves are visible across the surface, especially near the equator and poles. One of the most mysterious features is the hexagonal jet stream at the north pole, spanning over 30,000 kilometers (18,640 miles).
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        The most notable mission to Saturn was NASA’s Cassini spacecraft, which orbited the planet from 2004 to 2017. Cassini provided detailed images and data on the planet, rings, and moons — including Titan and Enceladus. Its findings dramatically changed our understanding of the Saturnian system. Future missions may target Titan or Enceladus, particularly due to their potential for life.
