        Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is often called the "Red Planet" due to the iron oxide prevalent on its surface. It has captivated human imagination for centuries, from ancient mythology to modern science fiction. Today, it’s a focal point for exploration due to its potential to harbor past or present life and its suitability for future human missions.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Mars is a cold, desert-like planet with a thin atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide. Despite its harsh environment, evidence suggests that liquid water once flowed across its surface, carving out valleys and creating vast lakebeds. Today, polar ice caps and seasonal water flows hint that water may still exist underground. Mars has seasons, dust storms, and a day length (sol) very similar to Earth's, making it a prime candidate for robotic and, eventually, human exploration.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Namesake</h2>
      <p>
        Mars is named after the Roman god of war due to its reddish appearance in the night sky, reminiscent of blood. In Greek mythology, Mars was known as Ares. Various cultures have historically associated the planet with fire, war, and aggression, but also with agriculture and fertility depending on the region.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
      <p>
        Mars has a diameter of about 6,792 kilometers (4,220 miles), roughly half the size of Earth. It orbits the Sun at an average distance of 228 million kilometers (142 million miles), or 1.52 AU (Astronomical Units). Because of this distance, one year on Mars (its orbital period) is about 687 Earth days. It is the second smallest planet in the solar system, but its surface area is nearly equivalent to Earth's dry land.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
      <p>
        Mars rotates once every 24.6 hours, just slightly longer than an Earth day. Its axis is tilted at about 25 degrees, which gives it seasons similar to Earth’s. However, its longer orbit means each season lasts about twice as long. Mars' elliptical orbit makes its southern hemisphere more affected by seasonal changes than the northern one, which leads to asymmetrical weather and temperature patterns across the planet.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Moons</h2>
      <p>
        Mars has two small moons: Phobos and Deimos. These irregularly shaped objects are thought to be captured asteroids. Phobos, the larger and closer of the two, is gradually spiraling inward and is expected to crash into Mars or break apart in about 50 million years. Both moons are heavily cratered and have been subjects of interest for potential future exploration due to their proximity and potential resources.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Mars has a dense core made primarily of iron, nickel, and sulfur, surrounded by a silicate mantle and a thin crust. Unlike Earth, Mars lacks active plate tectonics, but its surface shows signs of past tectonic activity and massive volcanic formations. Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in the solar system, and Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons, are prominent examples of Martian geological features that hint at a violent and dynamic past.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Surface and Atmosphere</h2>
      <p>
        The surface of Mars is covered in iron-rich dust that gives the planet its signature red color. The landscape includes the largest volcano (Olympus Mons), the deepest canyon (Valles Marineris), and extensive dry riverbeds and polar caps. Mars’ atmosphere is thin, about 100 times less dense than Earth’s, and composed mostly of carbon dioxide (95%), with nitrogen and argon. Temperatures vary widely from -140°C at the poles to 30°C near the equator during the day. Seasonal dust storms can encompass the entire planet, affecting robotic operations and solar power. Methane detections in the atmosphere have raised the possibility of biological or geological activity.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        Mars has been extensively explored by orbiters, landers, and rovers from various space agencies. NASA’s Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter are currently operating on the surface, seeking signs of past microbial life and testing new technology for future missions. The European Space Agency (ESA) and other international efforts have contributed to understanding Martian geology, weather, and potential for colonization. Upcoming missions aim to return samples from the surface and study Mars’ interior more deeply.
