      <p class="hero-description">
        Kalpana Chawla (1962–2003) was the first woman of Indian origin to travel to space. An aerospace engineer and astronaut, she flew two missions on Space Shuttle Columbia, serving as mission specialist and robotic arm operator. Tragically, she was lost along with six crew members during the STS-107 Columbia disaster. Her legacy continues to inspire countless people in India and beyond.

      <h2>Early Life & Education</h2>
      <p>
        Born March 17, 1962, in Karnal, Haryana, Kalpana was the youngest of four children. Fascinated by flight, she earned a BEng in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab Engineering College in 1982. She then moved to the U.S., earning an M.S. from the University of Texas–Arlington and a PhD in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Colorado.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>NASA Career & Astronaut Selection</h2>
      <p>
        After her PhD, she joined NASA Ames in 1988, working on computational fluid dynamics. In December 1994, she was selected as an astronaut candidate and began training in March 1995. She played key roles in EVA/Robotics and helped develop robotic systems used in missions.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>STS‑87: First Spaceflight</h2>
      <p>
        In November 1997, Kalpana flew as mission specialist on STS‑87 aboard Columbia, becoming the first woman of Indian origin in space. She operated the robotic arm to deploy the Spartan solar observatory. The satellite malfunctioned and had to be retrieved by spacewalking astronauts.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>STS‑107 & Columbia Tragedy</h2>
      <p>
        Kalpana returned to space in January 2003 as part of the STS‑107 crew. The mission involved over 80 scientific experiments in microgravity. On February 1, 2003, Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated during reentry due to wing damage caused during launch, killing all seven astronauts.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Legacy & Honors</h2>
      <p>
        Kalpana was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, NASA Distinguished Service Medal, and NASA Space Flight Medal. Honors include asteroid 51826 Kalpanachawla, India’s Kalpana‑1 satellite, supercomputers, scholarships, and institutions named after her across the world.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Inspiration & Influence</h2>
      <p>
        Kalpana’s journey from Karnal to NASA continues to inspire generations, especially women and students pursuing STEM. Her resilience, humility, and scientific excellence are commemorated through books, documentaries, student programs, and memorials globally.
