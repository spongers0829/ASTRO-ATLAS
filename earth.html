        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known world to support life. It has a dynamic atmosphere, liquid water, and a magnetic field that protects it from harmful space radiation. Home to diverse climates, ecosystems, and civilizations, Earth remains the cornerstone of planetary exploration and environmental study.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Earth is a water-rich terrestrial planet with an atmosphere that supports a vast range of life forms. It's the only planet known to host life, due to a combination of its distance from the Sun, geological activity, and protective magnetic field. Earth is constantly studied to better understand its climate systems, plate tectonics, ocean currents, and biosphere. The planet features mountains, oceans, forests, deserts, and polar regions, all contributing to its biodiversity and complexity. With a surface that is 71% covered by water and a constantly changing atmosphere, Earth continues to be a dynamic and evolving system.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Namesake</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike other planets, Earth’s name does not come from Greek or Roman mythology. It originates from the Old English and Germanic words meaning "ground" or "soil." Many languages still use variants of this root. Earth's name is unique among the planets, symbolizing its foundational role in human life and understanding of the universe.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
      <p>
        Earth has a diameter of about 12,756 kilometers (7,926 miles), making it the fifth-largest planet in the solar system. It is about 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) from the Sun—a distance known as 1 Astronomical Unit (AU). This placement allows Earth to maintain liquid water and a moderate climate, ideal for life. The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, orbits at an average distance of about 384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles), influencing tides and stabilizing Earth’s axial tilt.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
      <p>
        Earth completes one orbit around the Sun in 365.25 days, resulting in leap years every four years to align our calendar. It rotates once every 24 hours, creating the cycle of day and night. The axial tilt of approximately 23.5 degrees causes the seasons, as different parts of the planet receive varying amounts of sunlight throughout the year. The interplay of Earth's orbit and rotation affects climate patterns, weather systems, and biological cycles.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Moons</h2>
      <p>
        Earth has one natural satellite, the Moon. It is the fifth-largest moon in the solar system and has a significant impact on Earth's tides and rotation. The Moon is believed to have formed from the debris of a massive collision between Earth and a Mars-sized body early in the planet’s history. Its synchronous rotation means we always see the same face of the Moon. Lunar exploration has also taught us much about planetary formation and geology.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Earth is made up of several layers: a solid inner core, a liquid outer core, a viscous mantle, and a solid crust. The movement of molten material in the outer core generates Earth’s magnetic field, while plate tectonics in the crust lead to earthquakes and the formation of mountains and volcanoes. These geological processes have helped shape Earth's surface over billions of years and continue to influence its evolution.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Surface and Atmosphere</h2>
      <p>
        Earth's surface is incredibly diverse, featuring oceans, continents, mountains, valleys, deserts, ice caps, and rainforests. The atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with traces of carbon dioxide, argon, and other gases. This atmosphere supports complex life and protects the surface from harmful solar and cosmic radiation. Weather patterns and climate systems are driven by the Sun’s energy interacting with the atmosphere and oceans, leading to varied environments across the globe.
