        Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in our solar system, orbiting the Sun in just 88 Earth days. It is a rocky, heavily cratered world with extreme temperatures and a very thin atmosphere. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury isn't the hottest planet—Venus holds that title due to its thick greenhouse atmosphere. Mercury lacks weather, wind, and erosion like we experience on Earth, which is why many of its craters remain unchanged for billions of years.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, located at an average distance of about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles). With a diameter of 4,880 kilometers (3,032 miles), it is the smallest of the eight planets. Mercury’s surface is similar in appearance to the Moon, covered with craters from countless impacts. It has no moons or rings and completes an orbit around the Sun in only 88 Earth days. Despite being close to the Sun, its lack of a thick atmosphere means temperatures fluctuate drastically—ranging from a scorching 430°C (800°F) during the day to a frigid -180°C (-290°F) at night. Its proximity to the Sun and its iron-rich core make Mercury one of the densest planets in the solar system. Additionally, radar observations suggest the presence of water ice in permanently shadowed craters at its poles, which is surprising given the planet’s proximity to the Sun.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Namesake</h2>
      <p>
        Mercury is named after the Roman messenger god, known for his speed. The name is fitting because Mercury moves quickly across the sky, completing its orbit faster than any other planet. Ancient civilizations, including the Babylonians and Greeks, observed Mercury and were fascinated by its fast movement and proximity to the Sun. In Greek mythology, the planet was associated with Hermes, the swift-footed messenger of the gods. Because it appears so close to the Sun, it is often visible only during twilight and was sometimes mistaken for two different objects—one seen in the morning and the other in the evening.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
      <p>
        Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system, with a diameter just slightly larger than our Moon. It's about 0.38 times the size of Earth. The average distance from the Sun is 57.9 million kilometers (36 million miles), and because of its elliptical orbit, its distance from the Sun varies significantly. Mercury has a large metallic core that makes up about 85% of the planet’s radius, contributing to its high density. At its closest approach, called perihelion, Mercury is about 46 million kilometers from the Sun; at aphelion, it’s about 70 million kilometers away. These wide fluctuations contribute to its temperature extremes.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
      <p>
        A year on Mercury lasts just 88 Earth days, the shortest of all planets. However, a single day on Mercury (one full rotation on its axis relative to the Sun) takes 176 Earth days. This unique rotation-orbit ratio means that Mercury experiences extreme day-night cycles. Because of this, Mercury’s surface is subjected to prolonged periods of intense solar heating followed by long cold nights. The planet also exhibits a phenomenon known as a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, meaning it rotates three times on its axis for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Moons</h2>
      <p>
        Mercury has no natural moons or rings. This is likely due to its proximity to the Sun, which makes it difficult for the planet to gravitationally retain any satellites. Despite its lack of moons, Mercury remains an intriguing subject of study, particularly for understanding planetary formation and the effects of solar radiation on planetary surfaces. The absence of moons allows for more direct observation of its surface without additional gravitational complexities.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Mercury has a large iron core surrounded by a silicate mantle and a thin crust. The core makes up a large portion of the planet's mass, making Mercury the second densest planet after Earth. Observations from missions like NASA’s MESSENGER suggest that the core may still be partially molten. Mercury also has a weak magnetic field, unusual for a planet without a substantial atmosphere. Scientists believe this magnetic field is generated by a dynamo effect within the partially liquid core. This core-driven magnetism also results in space weather interactions with the solar wind.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Surface and Atmosphere</h2>
      <p>
        Mercury’s surface is marked by impact craters, ridges, and plains. Large basins such as Caloris Basin indicate ancient asteroid impacts. Some of these craters are permanently shadowed and cold enough to retain water ice. Unlike Earth, Mercury does not have a substantial atmosphere. Instead, it has an exosphere composed of atoms blasted off its surface by solar wind and micrometeoroid impacts. This exosphere includes elements like oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. Because of its lack of atmosphere, Mercury’s sky is black even in daylight, and the Sun appears more than three times larger than it does from Earth.
